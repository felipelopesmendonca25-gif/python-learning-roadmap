## Hello, my name is FELIPE MENDONÇA, and I am writing to inform you that 
I will be using Github for my personal portfolio, for a possible trip abroad 
for work. This message is being translated via a translator, which I am not ashamed 
to say, as I want you to see my progress not only as a programmer, but also as a 
person. I promise that soon the messages will be written based on my own learning. 
Thank you, and see you in the future...
